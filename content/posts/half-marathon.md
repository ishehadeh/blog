I ran a half-marathon yesterday!!

It was a goal of mine for a while. I had hoped to get there sometime this summer, but this works too.

## The Run

On Saturday I went for a longer run after work, it felt great, so I set a tentative goal to run 11 miles on Wednesday. It's been about 4 weeks since a ran 10, and my daily runs have been a lot bit longer the past couple weeks. So, it seemed reasonable to push my personal best.

Yesterday I set out to run a bit further than usual, in order to prepare for the longer run Wednesday. It turned out to be a perfect day for a run, a little chilly, but not enough to be uncomfortable, and the sun was shining. I ran the usual route through Historic St. Mary's City, past the visitor's center and onto the trail loop. From my dorm to the trails is about 2 miles, and the loop is roughly 3. I typically run about 5-10 minutes into the woods, then turn around for my daily runs. For longer runs, like yesterday, I'll do the whole loop.

My shoelace was loose, so I stopped tie it before getting into the woods. Then roughly 3 steps past the trail head I dropped an earbud taking off my jacket. I was a little bit peeved having to stop twice, but my time recovered, eventually.

About a quarter of the way though the trail I was feeling great, and I though why not run it twice. Maybe I could even get to 11mi today instead of Wednesday. Or, maybe I could even make it to a third? An extra loop would bring me to a 13mi total, after running back to the dorm. After thinking **a lot** about how cool it would be if I actually just ran 13 miles *right now*, I committed.

The rest of that loop was fantastic. The second I began to feel a bit worse, I definitely didn't drink enough water ahead of time. By the time I started on the third I didn't feel great. My feet were achy, I had a stitch in my side and my mouth was really, really dry; But, I was also over half way there. And, to be honest I was still having a good time. I was enjoying the conversation on [High and Mighty](https://headgum.com/high-and-mighty/344-matrix-trilogy-w-actionboyz) about The Matrix Trilogy. After I completed the last loop my watch read something around 11.75mi. Since the run back to my dorm was almost exactly 2mi, I ran a quarter mile into the woods.

Once I turned around every ailment mention cleared up. It felt almost like I had just started the run. I ran the last mile and a half at least a minute faster than the rest.

## Reflection

I'm trilled just to have run the distance, it was a big leap from previous highest, [10 miles](/posts/10mi). Although, I do want to work on the time. I ran 13.24 miles in 2:07:36, so my pace was 9'38"/mi. All the splits from miles 3-11 were hovering somewhere around 9:30 to 10:00, with the majority somewhere in 9:45-10 range. I'd love to bring those down to all hover around 9:30.

Part of the reason for the slower pace was that those were the miles on the trail. The trail wasn't particularly technical, but I've noticed even on shorter runs I consistently run a bit slower on it.
