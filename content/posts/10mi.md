I ran 10 miles today!

My previous record was 9mi, from about a year ago. That run was from the half-marathon training which I quit, right after. Getting up to that distance again felt amazing.

I'm still hoping to run a half-marathon some day. Though I don't want to push it. For the time being I'll just run when I feel like it, for whatever distance I can. This "plan" has been working much better than my training plan did last year. I've had much more fun on my runs, it's a good way to de-stress. I look forward to running now. It's not that it was never like that last year, but I found myself dreading the long runs more often than not. And eventually I just gave up on running.

Can't wait to run tomorrow :)
