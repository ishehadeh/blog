I'm really happy with this week. I ran 10 miles for the first time! Getting into the double digits feels like a significant milestone, it puts a half-marathon within reach.

Like I talked about in my [entry on Wednesday](/posts/10mi), I want to make this hobby sustainable. I have the tendency to push a little to hard and burn out on things. So, it's important to slow down and run for just 15 or 30 minutes if that's what I can do that day. I don't necessarily want to run everyday anyway, I think trying to keep a run streak up sounds fun, but I'm worried it would put on too much pressure. Thinking about the mental health benefits of running over the physical has been helpful. A short or slow run isn't a failure at all, often it's exactly what I need mentally. When trying to run *just* for exercise I feel like I need to always be running a little bit faster, or a little longer. Trying to get my pace up is fun, but it's easy to get a little to caught up in it. The only reason I want to run is that I enjoy *running*.

A small win this week was getting out to run on Tuesday and Thursday. I have an earlier start those days due to work, and by the time I get out of class I'm pretty tired. Usually end up deciding not to run on at least one of them. This week though I still managed to get in some easier runs both days, which felt great. They were shorter runs (especially Tuesday), but were exactly what I needed. Around school there's a pretty easy 1.5mi route, which I ran for the first time in a while on Tuesday. I'm hoping to go out to do short runs there more often.

I also was able to spend a lot more time out on the trails. Running through the woods is so, so peaceful. It feels completely different to running along the road, or even around campus. I'm going to try to do more of it this week, maybe even try out the *far* more technical trails behind my dorm.
